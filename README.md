# Innovation/Industry Engagement LWCs

This SFDX project includes two LWCs for use in the Industry Engagement 360 demo org. The Innovation Score Summary LWC relies on object and field information specific to the IE360 demo environment. The Information Classification Banner, however, does not have any specific object references and can be easily deployed to any Salesforce environment directly from this project. An unmanaged package is also available for the classification banner. Click [here](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t3h000004OUHq&isdtp=p1) to install in production.
